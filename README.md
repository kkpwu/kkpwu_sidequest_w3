## Description

This project is a multi-screen game built with the **p5.js library**, utilizing a state-based approach to manage interactive storytelling. The codebase is built upon the professors-provided framework for scene management, which was extended to include custom health and win-streak mechanics.

Inspired by the minimalist tension of _Dispatch_, the game challenges players to maintain a streak of 3 consecutive wins to succeed. It features a persistent Health Bar and a win-tracking system that resets upon failure, emphasizing the "quick thinking" required to navigate different game states across multiple JavaScript files.

## Learning Goals

- Practice separating code across multiple files for readability and maintenance.
- Implement clickable UI elements and timed challenges.
- Learn how to route `draw()`, `mousePressed()`, and `keyPressed()` logic based on the active game state.
- Design and implement a dynamic Health Bar UI using global variables.

## Assets

N/A

## GenAI

The core logic for the health bar, consecutive win system, and scene transition debugging was developed by Karen Wu with assistance from GenAi. AI helped refine the logic for Scene 2 and the global state handling in `sketch.js`.
